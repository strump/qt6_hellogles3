Sample OpenGL appllication with Qt 6 and OpenGL 4.1.

Qt 6 contains OpenGL sample with animation https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-hellogles3-example.html.
Original code could be found in https://github.com/qt/qtbase/tree/6.7.3/examples/opengl/hellogles3. This project is slightly and shows only simple triangle. No lighting, not texturing, no camera movement.
